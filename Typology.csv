Prevelance of Undernourishment,Prevalence of undernourishments is the percentage of the population whose habitual food consumption is insufficient to provide the dietary energy levels that are required to maintain a normal active and healthy life. ,2015 = 100,Utilization,FAOSTAT,https://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data/FS
Proportion of children moderately or severely stunted or wasted,Percentage of stunted and wasted(moderate and severe) children aged 0-59 months (moderate = height-for-age below -2 standard deviations from the WHO Child Growth Standards median; severe = height-for-age below -3 standard deviations from the WHO Child Growth Standards median).,2015 = 100,Utilization,FAOSTAT,https://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data/FS
Proportion of severely food insecure,Food insecurity is measured by the FAO using its Food Insecurity Experience Scale (FIES) global reference scale. The FIES measures the percentage of individuals in the population who have experienced food insecurity at severe levels during the reference period. Severe food insecurity is more strongly related to insufficient quantity of food (energy) and therefore strongly related to undernourishment or hunger.,%,Utilization,FAOSTAT,https://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data/FS
Food Diet Diversity,"The indicator expresses the energy supply (in kcal/caput/day) provided by cereals, roots and tubers as a percentage of the total Dietary Energy Supply (DES) (in kcal/caput/day) calculated from the correponding countries in the FAOSTAT food balance sheets. This indicator provides information on the quality of the diet. It provides a cross country comparable measure of the share of dietary energy supply derived from cereals, roots and tubers. Higher values mean less food diet diversity.",kcal/cap/day,Utilization,FAOSTAT,https://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data/FS
